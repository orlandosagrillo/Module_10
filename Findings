Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

- Question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components

- Answer: Total explained variance of the three principal components equates to 0.89004494. 
  Therefore using three principal components it would retain 89.00% of the variance.
  
Find the Best Value for k using the PCA Data¶

- Question: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?

- Answer: The best value for k when using the PCA data is a value of k = 4.

- Question: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

- Answer: Therefore it does not differ from the previous k value using the original data.
