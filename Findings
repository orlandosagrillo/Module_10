Find the Best Value for k using the Original Data¶

- Question: What is the best value for k?

- Answer: The best value for k is 4 where the line plot shows an elbow in the curve.

Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

- Question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components

- Answer: Total explained variance of the three principal components equates to 0.89004494. 
  Therefore using three principal components it would retain 89.00% of the variance.
  
Find the Best Value for k using the PCA Data¶

- Question: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?

- Answer: The best value for k when using the PCA data is a value of k = 4.

- Question: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

- Answer: Therefore it does not differ from the previous k value using the original data.

Visualise and Compare the Results¶

- Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

- Answer: Using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means will have an impact on both the time(during training) and complexity(upon application) along with the behaviour of the algorithm as well. The higher the number of features, the higher amount of information, and the higher the degrees of freedom, which means the higher flexibility when utilising the data. However using more features doesn't necessarily provide more useful information. Therefore, the results may be worst if their is an increase in irrelevant features as they cause higher uncertainity.
